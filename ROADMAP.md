## üéØ High Priority (Next Release)

### Dependency Manager Enhancements

#### 1. Auto-Add #Include Lines ‚≠ê **[DOCUMENTED]**
**Status:** Rules documented in `docs/INCLUDE_INSERTION_RULES.md`
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium

Automatically insert `#Include` statements when installing packages.

**Features:**
- Smart insertion location based on directives (#SingleInstance, #Requires)
- Intelligent include block detection and creation
- Duplicate prevention with filename normalization
- Preserve file formatting (EOL style, spacing)
- Preview before insertion
- Support both `#Include Lib/<Name>.ahk` and relative paths
- Handle edge cases (empty files, comments, multiple directives)

**User Flow:**
1. User installs package "JSON" from Dependency Manager
2. Extension detects active .ahk file or prompts to select target
3. Analyzes file structure and finds appropriate insertion point
4. Shows preview: "Add `#Include Lib/JSON.ahk` after line 2?"
5. User confirms ‚Üí Include line inserted with proper formatting
6. Success notification with "Open File" button

**Configuration Options (Future):**
- `ahk.includeFormat`: Template for include path (default: `Lib/{name}.ahk`)
- `ahk.autoInsertHeaders`: Auto-add #Requires and #SingleInstance (default: false)
- `ahk.headerOrder`: Order of directives to insert
- `ahk.confirmBeforeInsert`: Show preview dialog (default: true)

**Related Files:**
- Implementation: `src/includeLineInserter.ts` (to be created)
