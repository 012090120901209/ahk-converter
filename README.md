File Filtering: Only shows errors relevant to your current file

Example Runtime Error Detection:

C:\Users\...\Object_Literal_Error.ahk (7) : ==&gt; Missing "propertyname:" in object literal.
The assistant automatically parses this to identify:

File: Object_Literal_Error.ahk

Line: 7

Error: Missing "propertyname:" in object literal

How to Use:

Run your AHK script and see the error in Output window

Copy the error output from the Output panel

Run command: AHK: Add Output to Chat Monitor (or Ctrl+Shift+P)

Type @ahk /fix in Copilot Chat

The assistant sees both static diagnostics AND runtime errors!

This means you can simply type:

@ahk /fix - Automatically sees all problems and runtime errors

@ahk why is my script broken? - Reads Problems panel and Output window

@ahk what does this error mean? - Provides context-specific explanations with full context

Key AHK v2 Rules the Assistant Knows:

Use := for ALL assignments (never =)

Arrays are 1-indexed (not 0-indexed)

All control flow uses expressions (no legacy command syntax)

String concatenation uses the . operator

Use ComObject() not ComObjCreate()

Classes use modern OOP syntax with __New() constructor

GUI uses object-based approach with Gui() constructor

## Installation

Install AutoHotkey v2 from autohotkey.com

Install the AutoHotkey v2 LSP extension (recommended):

Search for “AutoHotkey v2 Language Support” by thqby

This provides accurate parsing, IntelliSense, and syntax highlighting

AHKv2 Toolbox will automatically detect and use it

Install this VS Code extension:

From VS Code Marketplace: Search for “AHKv2 Toolbox”

From VSIX: Download and install the .vsix file

From source: Open this folder in VS Code and press F5 to launch the Extension Host

If an .ahk file is active → Include is added immediately

If no .ahk file is active → Select from workspace files

The include line is inserted following smart rules:

Placed after #SingleInstance or #Requires directives

Appended to existing include block (never sorts)

Creates new block if none exists (with proper spacing)

Prevents duplicates (case-insensitive comparison)

Example Result:

#Requires AutoHotkey v2.1
#SingleInstance Force

#Include Lib/Arrays.ahk
#Include Lib/JSON.ahk      ; ← Newly added

; Your code here
MsgBox("Libraries loaded!")
Configuration:

ahkv2Toolbox.includeFormat - Template for include paths (default: Lib/{name}.ahk)

ahkv2Toolbox.autoInsertHeaders - Auto-add directives if missing (default: false)
