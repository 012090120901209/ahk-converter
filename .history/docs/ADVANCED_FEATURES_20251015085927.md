This document describes the advanced features implemented in Phase 4 of the AHK Converter VS Code extension.

## Overview

Phase 4 introduces enterprise-grade advanced features that make the AHK Converter extension production-ready and suitable for professional use cases. These features build upon the solid foundation established in Phases 1-3.

## üöÄ New Advanced Features

### 1. Advanced Conversion Options and Profiles

#### Conversion Profiles System
The extension now includes a comprehensive conversion profiles system that allows users to customize conversion behavior:

**Predefined Profiles:**
- **Conservative Profile**: Minimal changes, preserves most v1 syntax
- **Aggressive Profile**: Maximizes v2 syntax adoption
- **Custom Profile**: User-defined rules and settings

**Profile Features:**
- Rule-based conversion with customizable priority levels
- Selective conversion (choose which constructs to convert)
- Syntax preservation options
- Performance optimization settings
- Validation level configuration

**Profile Management:**
- Create custom profiles based on existing ones
- Import/export profiles for sharing
- Profile validation and testing
- Rule editing with live preview

### 2. Debugger Window Reader Integration

#### Seamless Integration
The Debugger Window Reader is now fully integrated with the converter:

**Integration Features:**
- Automatic launch after conversion
- Data sharing between converter and debugger
- Debug assistance for converted code
- Real-time error analysis
- Performance monitoring during debugging

**Debugging Assistance:**
- Automatic breakpoint suggestions
- Variable watch recommendations
- Call stack analysis
- Issue detection and fixing
- Performance optimization suggestions

**Data Sharing:**
- Conversion context passed to debugger
- Debug session history
- Error correlation between conversion and runtime
- Performance metrics integration

### 3. Performance Optimization for Large Files

#### Streaming Processing
Large files are now processed using streaming technology:

**Performance Features:**
- Chunk-based processing with configurable sizes
- Memory usage monitoring and limits
- Progress tracking with cancellation support
- Automatic optimization based on file size
- Performance metrics and reporting

**Optimization Options:**
- Configurable chunk size (100-5000 lines)
- Memory usage limits (50-1000 MB)
- Streaming vs. standard processing modes
- Background processing for large files
- Resource usage monitoring

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- Processing speed metrics
- Chunk processing time analysis
- Peak memory usage reporting
- Performance bottleneck detection

### 4. Conversion Profiles System

#### Profile Architecture
The conversion profiles system provides a flexible framework for customizing conversion behavior:

**Profile Structure:**
```typescript
interface ConversionProfile {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  rules: ConversionRule[];
  preserveSyntax: string[];
  selectiveConversion: SelectiveConversionOptions;
  performance: PerformanceOptions;
  validation: ValidationOptions;
}
```

**Rule System:**
- Category-based organization (syntax, functions, variables, commands, directives)
- Priority levels for rule execution
- Custom logic support
- Pattern matching and replacement
- Enable/disable per rule

**Selective Conversion:**
- Choose which constructs to convert:
  - Functions, variables, commands, directives, hotkeys, hotstrings
- Include/exclude patterns
- Fine-grained control over conversion process

### 5. Telemetry and Usage Analytics

#### Anonymous Usage Tracking
The extension now includes comprehensive telemetry for usage analysis:

**Data Collection:**
- Conversion success/failure rates
- Performance metrics
- Error patterns and frequency
- Feature usage statistics
- Profile usage analytics
- Conversion time distributions

**Analytics Features:**
- Daily, weekly, and monthly reports
- Performance trend analysis
- Error pattern recognition
- Usage correlation analysis
- Export/import of telemetry data

**Privacy Controls:**
- Complete opt-in/opt-out
- Local data storage only
- Anonymous data aggregation
- Configurable retention periods
- Data export capabilities

**Available Metrics:**
- Conversion statistics (success rate, processing time)
- Error analysis (types, frequency, recovery actions)
- Performance metrics (memory usage, processing speed)
- Usage patterns (feature adoption, workflow efficiency)
- Profile effectiveness (conversion quality by profile)
